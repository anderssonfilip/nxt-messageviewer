NXT Message Viewer
=================

Experiment to read and view messages stored in the Nxt blockchain

This app parses the nxt blockchain for embedded messages and displays them in a tree structures. The h2 database of the Nxt client must be available.

Dependencies:

Java 8
Play 2.3.0 (http://www.playframework.com/download)
Nxt (https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/commits/all)

I will try to keep up with the Nxt implementation, version used currently is 1.1.4
Other dependencies should be resolved by sbt build file
